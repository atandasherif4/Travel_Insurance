## CONCLUSION
  After analysing the dataset, the following were the recommendations made for the company.

### RECOMMENDATION

- Increase in advertisement quality: There should be focus on offering insights and value that give customers reason to care. Taking a look at the case in the analysis of how customers not having chronic diseases still bought travel insurance. But non-customers with chronic diseases still didn’t purchase. The risks associated with not getting their travel insurance should be emphasized. 
 
There should be production of excellence on advertising quality with a focus on improving the company.

- Take advantage of existing customers: Loyal customers should be encouraged to recommend to their network. One of this can be done by sharing the company’s content on social media or referral, this helps build trust and credibility.

- Reaching out to journalist and bloggers whose audience may be interested in what the company is offering.
